# Spiling

Spiling aims to turn authoritative CAD/BREP geometry and explicit manufacturing requirements into inspectable, verified manufacturing artifacts—not just a mesh preview. The intended workbench preserves geometry and source-face identity from import through planning, then independently verifies the emitted machine program.

The first intended product is a recoverable STEP-to-print workflow for one tested machine configuration, with a desktop workbench and CLI using the same native Rust engine.

## Status

**Spiling is not a functional manufacturing product yet. It is not recommended for use.**

The current implementation is runtime bootstrap and diagnostics: a desktop shell, engine/CLI communication, and a synthetic triangle diagnostic. CAD import, project editing, slicing, machine-program verification, and printable-job export are not implemented.

Packaged WebGPU presentation and physical-platform acceptance remain unverified. Windows, macOS, and Linux are intended targets, not certified support claims. See the [acceptance evidence](docs/quality/B0-evidence.md) for measured results and unmet gates.

## Experimental installation from source

This setup is for contributors evaluating the unfinished bootstrap, not for manufacturing or operating a machine.

Install Node **24.x**, Rustup, and the [platform-native prerequisites](docs/quality/development.md#prerequisites), then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pquerna/spiling.git
cd spiling
npm install --global pnpm@10.32.1
pnpm bootstrap
```

The repository pins the Rust toolchain and dependencies. The first native build downloads a substantial CEF distribution. See the [development and packaging guide](docs/quality/development.md) for launching the development shell, checks, and experimental packages.
