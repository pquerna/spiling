# Software manufacturing inputs rules

- Own original, redistributable printer-specification and intent inputs for the software compiler/replay gate, not physical printer calibration or supported-machine declarations.
- Author printer data in TypeScript against generated protocol types; the same Rust contracts validate inert intent JSON in the engine. Never maintain a second domain schema here.
- Keep profile, material and recipe identity/revision, units, frames and limits explicit. Changes to frozen measured inputs require a new revision and evidence hashes.
- Component shapes are descriptive metadata, not proof of collision checking. Nominal material/flow values are software inputs, not measured printability or thermal parameters.
- Compile trusted TypeScript with `pnpm manufacturing:intent SOURCE.ts NEW.json`, then exercise actual CLI compile, independent replay, checkpoint and fresh-process reopen. A type check alone does not establish manufacturing correctness.
