# Software manufacturing inputs rules

- Own original, redistributable printer-specification and intent inputs for the software compiler/replay gate, not physical printer calibration or supported-machine declarations.
- Author printer data in TypeScript against generated protocol types; the same Rust contracts validate inert intent JSON in the engine. Never maintain a second domain schema here.
- Keep profile, material and recipe identity/revision, units, frames and limits explicit. Changes to frozen measured inputs require a new revision and evidence hashes.
- All printer/intent metadata uses manufacturing schema8 without old-schema readers. Diagnostic profile revision8 and complete Marlin profile revision7 identify this cutover. Recipes retain positive native_shape_error_mm, explicit nearest seam and alternating_xy axis policies. Local whole-volume process overrides are project-owned, not extra recipe fields. Source STEP corpora and configuration/calibration bytes remain unchanged.
- Component shapes are descriptive metadata, not proof of collision checking. Material/flow/temperature values are declared software inputs, not measurements. Diagnostic and complete Marlin profiles remain explicitly unqualified; configuration/calibration record hashes identify exact published bytes, not firmware approval. Revise records and their profile hashes together.
- Compile trusted TypeScript with `pnpm manufacturing:intent SOURCE.ts NEW.json`, then exercise actual CLI compile, independent replay, checkpoint and fresh-process reopen. A type check alone does not establish manufacturing correctness.
